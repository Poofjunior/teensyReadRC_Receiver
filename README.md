teensyReadRC_Receiver
=====================

Test code for reading a 6 (or less) channel RC receiver using a Teensy 3
with interrupts.

Note: Teensy 3 supports 5V-tolerant inputs. Receiver channels may be 
plugged in directly to the Teensy.

Note: This project may be compiled with the [Arduino-Makefile](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) project or conventionally within the Arduino
IDE.
